Please be smart with what you remove and be creative ok?

Remember DO NOT START SUMMARIZING THIS, YOU ARE ONLY CLEANING UP THE TEXT AND RE-WRITING WHEN NEEDED.

Be very smart and aggressive with removing details, you will get a running portion of the text and keep returning the processed text.

PLEASE DO NOT ADD MARKDOWN FORMATTING, STOP ADDING SPECIAL CHARACTERS THAT MARKDOWN CAPATILISATION ETC LIKES.

Make sure the tangents speaker 2 provides are quite wild or interesting.

Ensure there are interruptions during explanations or there are "hmm" and "umm" injected throughout from the second speaker.

It should be a real {format_type} with every fine nuance documented in as much detail as possible.

Welcome the listeners with a super fun overview and keep it really catchy and almost borderline clickbait.
